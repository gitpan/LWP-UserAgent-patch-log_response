NAME
    LWP::UserAgent::patch::log_response - Patch module for LWP::UserAgent

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
     use LWP::UserAgent::patch::log_response
         -log_response_header => 1, # default 1
         -log_response_body   => 1, # default 0
     ;

     # now all your LWP HTTP responses are logged

    Sample script and output:

     % TRACE=1 perl -MLog::Any::App -MLWP::UserAgent::patch::log_response \
       -MLWP::Simple -e'getprint "http://www.google.com/"'

DESCRIPTION
    This module patches LWP::UserAgent (which is used by LWP::Simple,
    WWW::Mechanize, among others) so that HTTP responses are logged using
    Log::Any.

    Response body is logged in category "LWP_Response_Body.*" so it can be
    separated. For example, to dump response body dumps to directory instead
    of file:

     use Log::Any::App '$log',
        -category_level => {LWP_Response_Body => 'off'},
        -dir            => {
            path           => "/path/to/dir",
            level          => 'off',
            category_level => {LWP_Response_Body => 'trace'},
        };

FAQ
  Why not subclass?
    By patching, you do not need to replace all the client code which uses
    LWP (or WWW::Mechanize, etc).

SEE ALSO
    Use Net::HTTP::Methods::patch::log_request to log raw HTTP requests
    being sent to servers.
